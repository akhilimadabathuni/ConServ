**ConServ** is a high-fidelity clickable prototype demonstrating a paradigm shift in home construction: a **Human + AI Partnership**. It uses the power of AI to solve the industry's biggest initial hurdle—cost and material estimation—and then leverages that clarity to foster a transparent, collaborative, and human-led project journey.

## Problem Statment : The Chaos of Home Construction 

Building a home is a dream, but the reality is often a nightmare of opacity, delays, and mistrust. The core issue is the lack of a shared, transparent foundation of data from day one. Homeowners are overwhelmed, and even the best contractors struggle with manual, time-consuming estimation processes.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Estimates, Human-Led Collaboration

ConServ's radical but practical solution is to augment, not replace, the human element. We believe that while AI is brilliant at processing vast amounts of data, the nuance of negotiation, the creativity of planning, and the reality of on-site management require human expertise.

Our platform is built on this synergy:

*   **Step 1: AI Does the Heavy Lifting.** Our Gemini-powered engine acts as a world-class estimator. In seconds, it analyzes the user's vision and generates a detailed, localized, and transparent budget. This removes weeks of uncertainty and provides an objective, data-driven starting point.

*   **Step 2: Humans Take the Lead.** With the AI-generated estimate as a shared source of truth, our platform becomes a collaborative hub. The rest of the journey is a partnership between the homeowner and a dedicated **ConServ human team** (project managers, engineers, and advisors).

## The User Journey: A Transparent Partnership

The application guides the user through a seamless four-step journey, designed to build trust by combining instant data with human-led support.

### 1. Define: The Blueprint Wizard

The journey begins with an intuitive wizard where the user defines their dream home. The AI works in the background, preparing to generate the initial blueprint.

### 2. Review: AI-Informed Negotiation

The user receives the AI-generated estimate. This is the first touchpoint with the human team. The **"Negotiation Hub"** isn't a chatbot; it's a direct line to a project advisor. The user, empowered with a detailed budget and AI-powered tips, can have a meaningful, transparent discussion with a human expert to refine the plan.

### 3. Finalize: A Clear Commitment

Once the homeowner and the ConServ team have collaboratively finalized the plan, the user moves to a secure screen to make the initial booking payment, officially kicking off the human-led project management phase.

### 4. Track: The Collaborative Dashboard

Post-booking, the dashboard becomes the command center for the homeowner and their dedicated project manager. It's a shared space for tracking milestones, viewing human-curated weekly updates, managing payments, and resolving issues through a transparent support system.
