**ConServ** is a high-fidelity clickable prototype demonstrating a paradigm shift in home construction: a **Human + AI Partnership**. It uses the power of AI to solve the industry's biggest initial hurdle—cost and material estimation—and then leverages that clarity to foster a transparent, collaborative, and human-led project journey.

## 🛑 Problem Statement: The Chaos of Home Construction

Building a home is a dream, but the reality is often a nightmare of **opacity, delays, and mistrust**. The core issue is the lack of a shared, transparent foundation of data from day one. Homeowners are overwhelmed, and even the best contractors struggle with manual, time-consuming estimation processes.


### The Solution: AI-Powered Estimates, Human-Led Collaboration

ConServ's radical but practical solution is to **augment, not replace**, the human element. We believe that while AI is brilliant at processing vast amounts of data, the nuance of negotiation, the creativity of planning, and the reality of on-site management require human expertise.

Our platform is built on this synergy:

* **Step 1: AI Does the Heavy Lifting.** Our Gemini-powered engine acts as a world-class estimator. In seconds, it analyzes the user's vision and generates a detailed, localized, and transparent budget. This removes weeks of uncertainty and provides an objective, data-driven starting point.

* **Step 2: Humans Take the Lead.** With the AI-generated estimate as a shared source of truth, our platform becomes a collaborative hub. The rest of the journey is a partnership between the homeowner and a dedicated **ConServ human team** (project managers, engineers, and advisors).

## 🚶 The User Journey: A Transparent Partnership

The application guides the user through a seamless four-step journey, designed to build trust by combining instant data with human-led support.

### 1. Define: The Blueprint Wizard

The journey begins with an intuitive wizard where the user defines their dream home. The AI works in the background, preparing to generate the initial blueprint.

### 2. Review: AI-Informed Negotiation

The user receives the AI-generated estimate. This is the first touchpoint with the human team. The **"Negotiation Hub"** isn't a chatbot; it's a direct line to a project advisor. The user, empowered with a detailed budget and AI-powered tips, can have a meaningful, transparent discussion with a human expert to refine the plan.

### 3. Finalize: A Clear Commitment

Once the homeowner and the ConServ team have collaboratively finalized the plan, the user moves to a secure screen to make the initial booking payment, officially kicking off the human-led project management phase.

### 4. Track: The Collaborative Dashboard

Post-booking, the dashboard becomes the command center for the homeowner and their dedicated project manager. It's a shared space for tracking milestones, viewing human-curated weekly updates, managing payments, and resolving issues through a transparent support system.
